##A sample application showing how to use color grading in LibGdx.
Written by [cypherdare](https://github.com/cypherdare) for the game [Lethal Running](http:/www.lethalrunning.com).

This is a standard LibGDX project you can import normally from the `build.gradle`. 
When you run the DesktopLauncher:


`F1` applies the base color grade table that should not noticeably change any colors. This demonstrates that the shader code is correct.

`F2-F5` apply some other color grade tables I generated.

`F6` toggles the color grade shader. You can use this while the `F1` table is applied to see that the base color grade table does not visibly change the original colors.

`F7` toggles the overlay of the color table in the top left corner.
